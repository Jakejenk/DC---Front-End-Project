- Overview : The function of the website is to allow a user to select a Premier League soccer team by name, and compare the betting lines offered by various betting websites in one, easy place. The site takes uses data from a Soccer API, and inputs the Premier league team names into a drop down bar. The user then selects a team, and the Sports Betting API is called. The name of the team is passed into that API, and the API returns the different lines from different websites. The code then takes this data and formats it into containers.
